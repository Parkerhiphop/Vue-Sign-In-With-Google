# Vue Sign In With Google

> Inspired by [google-onetap-signin-client-vue](https://github.com/Zensynthium/google-onetap-signin-client-vue)

This is a basic example of sign in with google in vue.

It should work with [Express Sign in with Google](https://github.com/Parkerhiphop/Express-Sign-In-With-Google).
